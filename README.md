# MusicDJ bot
This bot is able to return any lyrics from the given title and artist. Further features will be potentially implemented soon like the ones below:
- specific lyrics extraction & provide word cloud, emotions, and analysis
- Generate genre cluster from range of decades -> can specify the word correlated and song inside each cluster
- Thematic song finder (song recommendation through a word)
- find top songs of specific decades
- find recommendation songs through song title
- specific analysis through graphs (drasstic change)
- Lyric generation for future 
- Top 100 songs billboard

Ideas that are beyond the scope, but would be so cool if implemented:
- log in spotify account and authentication of others by username and password only
- Playlist sorting for your spotify account
- Song recommendation like "daily mix" from spotify
- your personalised emotional graph related to songs
- word cloud describes you based on the songs in your playlist
- Using tune and music notes as reference for emnotional and genres clustering.
